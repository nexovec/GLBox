# GLBox

OpenGL sandbox in C-style C++. # FIXME: you need to go into vendor/glfw and `git pull origin master`

## How to Build

Make sure you have Windows with git installed on it.
Press WIN+E, press CTRL+L, type cmd, press ENTER, then type:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/nexovec/GLBox.git --recursive
cd GLBox
.\\run.bat
```

> NOTE: I didn't test on linux, but this should not use any platform specific functionality for the core app.
