# GLBox

OpenGL sandbox for algorithm visualization in C++.

## How to build

Make sure you have Windows with git installed on it. Optionally you should have `MSBuild.exe` in your PATH (This necessitates `Visual Studio Build Tools 2022`).
Open a folder in file explorer, press `CTRL+L`, type `cmd`, press `ENTER`, then type:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/nexovec/GLBox.git --recursive
cd GLBox
.\\run.bat
```

If you skipped the optional requirement, you will have to open `GLBox.sln` in `Visual Studio 2022` and press `F5` (first run might take a while).

> NOTE: I didn't test on linux, but this should not use any platform specific functionality for the core app.
